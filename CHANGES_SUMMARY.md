- ‚úÖ Backward compatible
- ‚úÖ Database migrations automatic
- ‚úÖ Existing data safe

### Next Step:

## üîÑ Migration Safety

### What Happens on Deploy:
1. Server starts
2. Connects to PostgreSQL database
3. Runs migrations (adds new columns)
4. Creates admin user (if not exists)
5. Creates default services (if not exists)
6. Ready to accept requests

### Data Safety:
- ‚úÖ Existing users preserved
- ‚úÖ Existing bookings preserved
- ‚úÖ Existing services preserved
- ‚úÖ Only adds new columns
- ‚úÖ No data deleted

---

## üìù Important Notes

### Admin Credentials:
- **Default:** admin@gmail.com / admin123
- Change password after first login!
- Only one admin account by default

### Service Prices:
- 8 default services (‚Ç±200 - ‚Ç±1000)
- Admin can add unlimited services
- Services can be edited anytime
- Price changes don't affect past bookings

### Booking Amounts:
- New bookings save exact total_amount
- Old bookings use service price as fallback
- Frontend displays correctly either way
